# Welcome to Amber

**Amber** is a web application framework written in [Crystal](http://www.crystal-lang.org) inspired by Kemal, Rails, Phoenix and other popular application frameworks.

The purpose of Amber is not to create yet another framework, but to take advantage of the beautiful Crystal language capabilities and provide engineers an efficient, cohesive, and well maintain web framework for the crystal community that embraces the language philosophies, conventions, and guides.

Amber Crystal borrows concepts that already have been battle tested, successful, and embrace new concepts through team and community collaboration and analysis, that aligns with Crystal philosophies.

## Amber Philosophy H.R.T.

*It's all about the community. Software development is a team sport!*

It's not enough to be brilliant when you're alone in your programming lair. You are not going to change the world or delight millions of users by hiding and preparing your secret invention. We need to work with other members, we need to share our visions, divide the labor, learn from others, we need to be a team.

**HUMILITY** We are not the center of the universe. You're neither omniscient nor infallible. You are open to self-improvement.

**RESPECT** You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them as human beings and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.

**TRUST** You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you are OK with letting them drive when appropriate.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  amber:
    github: Amber-Crystal/amber
```

## Usage

*src/yourapp.cr*
```cr
# The first line requires the framework library.
require "amber"
# requires all of your controllers, models, etc.
require "./**"
require "../config/*"

# Finally this is how you will bootup the server.
Amber::Server.instance.run
```

*config/application.cr*
```crystal
# This line represents how you will define your application configuration.
Amber::Server.instance do
  # Server options
  app_path = __FILE__ # Do not change unless you understand what you are doing.
  name = "Hello World App" # A descriptive name for your app
  port = 8080 # Port you wish your app to run
  env = "development".colorize(:yellow).to_s
  log = ::Logger.new(STDOUT)
  log.level = ::Logger::INFO
end
```

*config/routes.cr*
```cr
Amber::Server.instance do
  # Every Amber application needs to define a pipeline set of pipes
  # each pipeline allow a set of middleware transformations to be applied to
  # different sets of route, this give you granular control and explicitness
  # of which transformation to run for each of the app requests.

  # All api scoped routes will run these transformations

  pipeline :web do
    # Plug is the method to use connect a pipe (middleware)
    # A plug accepts an instance of HTTP::Handler

    plug Amber::Pipe::Logger.new
    plug Amber::Pipe::Flash.new
    plug Amber::Pipe::Session.new
    plug Amber::Pipe::CSRF.new
  end

  # All static content will run these transformations
  pipeline :static do
    plug HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new("./public")
    plug HTTP::CompressHandler.new
  end

  routes :static do
    # Each route is defined as follow
    # verb resource : String, controller : Symbol, action : Symbol
    get "/*", StaticController, :index
  end

  # This is how you define the routes for your application
  # HTTP methods supported [GET, PATCH, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS]
  # Read more about HTTP methods here
  # (HTTP METHODS)[https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html]
  routes :web do
    # Each route is defined as follow
    # verb, resources : String, controller : Symbol, action : Symbol,
    get "/", HelloController, :world
    get "/hello", HelloController, :world
    get "/hello/:planet", HelloController, :world
    get "/hello/template_demo/:name", HelloController, :template_demo
  end
end
```

*src/controllers/hello_controller.cr*
```cr
class HelloController < Amber::Controller::Base
  def world
    "Hello World"
  end

  def template_demo
    render "template_demo.slang" # renders views/hello/template_demo.slang with layout views/layouts/application.slang
  end
end
```

*src/views/hello/template_demo.slang*
```slim
h1 Hey You!
p
  | Welcome to the Machine.
```

*src/views/layouts/application.slang*
```slim
html
  head
    title A New Machine (Part 1)
  body
    == content
